A friend of mine opened a carpentry shop with beautiful designs based on epoxy resin and wood. To help him out, 
I suggested he create a portfolio application where the user could view photo galleries of individual projects 
with descriptions of the manufacturing technology and contact him by email if he wanted to buy a similar project. 
The administrator, after logging in, would be able to edit all the projects on the website. 
The application will run on the Azure cloud.
